/**
  * EXERCISE 5.1] Write a function to convert a `Stream` to a `List`, which will force its evaluation and let
  *               you look at it in the REPL. You can convert to the regular `List` type in the standard
  *               library. You can place this and other functions that operate on a `Stream` inside the
  *               Stream trait.
