/** EXERCISE 5.16] Hard: Generalize `tails` to the function `scanRight`, which is like a `foldRight` that
  *               returns a stream of the intermediate results. For example:
  *
  * @{{{
  * scala> Stream(1, 2, 3).scanRight(0)(_ + _).toList
  * res0: List[Int] = List(6, 5, 3, 0)
  * }}}
  *
  *               This example should be equivalent to the expression `List(1 + 2 + 3 + 0, 2 + 3 + 0, 3 + 0, 0)`.
  *               Your function should reuse intermediate results so that traversing a `Stream` with `n`
  *               elements always takes time linear in n. Can it be implemented using unfold? How, or
  *               why not? Could it be implemented using another function weâ€™ve written?
