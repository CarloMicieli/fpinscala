/** EXERCISE 6.7] Hard: If you can combine two `RNG` transitions, you should be able to combine a whole
  *              list of them. Implement sequence for combining a `List` of transitions into a single
  *              transition. Use it to reimplement the `ints` function you wrote before. For the latter,
  *              you can use the standard library function `List.fill(n)(x)` to make a list with `x`
  *              repeated `n` times.
