/**
  * EXERCISE 4.8] In this implementation, `map2` is only able to report one error, even if both the name
  *               and the age are invalid. What would you need to change in order to report both errors?
  *               Would you change `map2` or the signature of `mkPerson`? Or could you create a new data
  *               type that captures this requirement better than `Either` does, with some additional
  *               structure? How would `orElse`, `traverse`, and `sequence` behave differently for that
  *               data type?
