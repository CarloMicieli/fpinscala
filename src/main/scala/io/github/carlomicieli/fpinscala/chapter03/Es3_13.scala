/** EXERCISE 3.13] Can you write `foldLeft` in terms of `foldRight`? How about the other way
  *              around? Implementing `foldRight` via `foldLeft` is useful because it lets us
  *              implement `foldRight` tail-recursively, which means it works even for large
  *              lists without overflowing the stack.
