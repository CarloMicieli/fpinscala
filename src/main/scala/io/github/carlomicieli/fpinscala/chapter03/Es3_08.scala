/** EXERCISE 3.8] See what happens when you pass `Nil` and `Cons` themselves to `foldRight`,
  *              like this:
  * @example {{{
  *        foldRight(List(1,2,3), Nil:List[Int])(Cons(_,_))
  * }}}
  *              What do you think this says about the relationship between
  *              `foldRight` and the data constructors of `List`?
