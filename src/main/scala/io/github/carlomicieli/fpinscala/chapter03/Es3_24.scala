/**
  * EXERCISE 3.24] Hard: As an example, implement `hasSubsequence` for checking whether a `List`
  *                contains another `List` as a subsequence. For instance, `List(1,2,3,4)` would have
  *                `List(1,2)`, `List(2,3)`, and `List(4)` as subsequences, among others. You may have
  *                some difficulty finding a concise purely functional implementation that is also
  *                efficient. That's okay. Implement the function however comes most naturally.
  *
  *                Note: Any two values `x` and `y` can be compared for equality in Scala using the expression `x == y`.
