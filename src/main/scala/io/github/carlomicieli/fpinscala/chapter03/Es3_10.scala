/**
  * EXERCISE 3.10] Our implementation of `foldRight` is not tail-recursive and will result in a StackOverflowError
  *                for large lists (we say itâ€™s not stack-safe). Convince yourself that this is the
  *                case, and then write another general list-recursion function, `foldLeft`, that is
  *                tail-recursive, using the techniques we discussed in the previous chapter.
