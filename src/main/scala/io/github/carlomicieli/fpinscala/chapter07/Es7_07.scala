/** EXERCISE 7.7] Hard: Given `map(y)(id) == y`, it’s a free theorem that
  *             `map(map(y)(g))(f) == map(y)(f compose g)`.
  *             (This is sometimes called map fusion, and it can be used as an
  *             optimization—rather than spawning a separate parallel computation to compute the
  *             second mapping, we can fold it into the first mapping.) Can you prove it? You may
  *             want to read the paper “Theorems for Free!” (http://mng.bz/Z9f1) to better understand
  *             the “trick” of free theorems.
