/** EXERCISE 9.1] Using `product`, implement the now-familiar combinator `map2` and then use this to
  * implement `many1` in terms of `many`. Note that we could have chosen to make `map2`
  * primitive and defined `product` in terms of `map2` as weâ€™ve done in previous chapters.
  * The choice is up to you.
  *
  * @example {{{
  *   def map2[A,B,C](p: Parser[A], p2: Parser[B])(f: (A,B) => C): Parser[C]
  * }}}
