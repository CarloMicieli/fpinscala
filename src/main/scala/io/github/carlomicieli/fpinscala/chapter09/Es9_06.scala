/** EXERCISE 9.6] Using flatMap and any other combinators, write the context-sensitive parser we
  * couldnâ€™t express earlier. To parse the digits, you can make use of a new primitive,
  * regex , which promotes a regular expression to a Parser . 10 In Scala, a string s can
  * be promoted to a Regex object (which has methods for matching) using s.r , for
  * instance, "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*".r .
  *
  * @example {{{
  *   implicit def regex(r: Regex): Parser[String]
  * }}}
