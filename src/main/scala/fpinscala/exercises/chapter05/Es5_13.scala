/**
 * EXERCISE 5.13] Use `unfold` to implement `map`, `take`, `takeWhile`, `zipWith` (as in chapter 3), and
 *                `zipAll`. The `zipAll` function should continue the traversal as long as either stream
 *                has more elementsâ€”it uses `Option` to indicate whether each stream has been
 *                exhausted.
