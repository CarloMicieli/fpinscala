/**
  * EXERCISE 5.13] Use `unfold` to implement `map`, `take`, `takeWhile`, `zipWith` (as in chapter 3), and
  *                `zipAll`. The `zipAll` function should continue the traversal as long as either stream
  *                has more elementsâ€”it uses `Option` to indicate whether each stream has been
  *                exhausted.
