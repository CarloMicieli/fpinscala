/**
 * EXERCISE 3.10] Our implementation of foldRight is not tail-recursive and will result in a StackOverflowError
 *                for large lists (we say itâ€™s not stack-safe). Convince yourself that this is the
 *                case, and then write another general list-recursion function, foldLeft, that is
 *                tail-recursive, using the techniques we discussed in the previous chapter.
