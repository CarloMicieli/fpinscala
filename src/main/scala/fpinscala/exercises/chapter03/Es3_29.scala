/**
  * EXERCISE 3.29] Generalize `size`, `maximum`, `depth`, and `map`, writing a new
  *                function `fold` that abstracts over their similarities.
  *                Implement them in terms of this more general function. Can
  *                you draw an analogy between this fold function and the left and right
  *                folds for List ?
