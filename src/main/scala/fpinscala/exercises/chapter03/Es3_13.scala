/**
 * EXERCISE 3.13] Can you write foldLeft in terms of foldRight ? How about the other way
 *                around? Implementing foldRight via foldLeft is useful because it lets us implement
 *                foldRight tail-recursively, which means it works even for large lists without
 *                overflowing the stack.
