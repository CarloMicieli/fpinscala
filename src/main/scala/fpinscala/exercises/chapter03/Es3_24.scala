/**
 * EXERCISE 3.24] Hard: As an example, implement hasSubsequence for checking whether a List
 *                contains another List as a subsequence. For instance, List(1,2,3,4) would have
 *                List(1,2) , List(2,3) , and List(4) as subsequences, among others. You may have
 *                some difficulty finding a concise purely functional implementation that is also
 *                efficient. That’s okay. Implement the function however comes most naturally. We’ll
 *                return to this implementation in chapter 5 and hopefully improve on it. Note: Any
 *                two values x and y can be compared for equality in Scala using the expression x == y .
